- Apply application code updates if any required.
- AMA offers a set of migration recipes designed to automate specific code migrations. 
- These recipes can be executed by copying the configuration into a Maven or Gradle file and initiating a build. 
- Alternatively, the migration plan can be imported into watsonx Code Assistant (WCA), which facilitates recipe execution. 
- For more complex code migrations and unit test generation, WCAâ€™s generative AI capabilities provide additional support.
